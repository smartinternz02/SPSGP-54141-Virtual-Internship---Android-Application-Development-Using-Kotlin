### INTRODUCTION
1. ### Overview
- As we can't remember everything, users frequently forget to buy the things they want to buy. Whenever we go to shop for something, one of the things we commonly do is make a  list of items we intend to buy as it is common to forget something if we do not. But an issue with paper lists is that they can be spoiled, torn or lost easily. Also, we need to carry a pen to mark what is bought already. This is both cumbersome and a waste of resources.
2. ### Purpose 
- This is a listing app that tries to resolve this problem. You can enter what you want to buy, in what quantity and its price. It also computes the total price that item will cost. This allows us to reduce clutter as we only need to carry out phone with us to have the list with us.

### LITERATURE SURVEY 
1. ### Existing problem 
- The main aim of this project is to list the items so that whenever users go to grocery stores, users will not be able to forget their items and this grocery application helps the users to tackle their day-to-day chaos more effortlessly. It’s not easy for the users to remember every item in this hectic lifestyle, they frequently can’t recall their required necessity so we decided to build an app to store the items in the database for their future use. After buying the items users can delete the added items in the database.
2. ### Proposed solution 
- The goal of this project is to make an app that stores the user items in a cart and can modify and delete the added item in the list. To develop a reliable system, I have some specific goals such as:
  1. Develop a system such that users can add item details like product name, product Quantity, and Product Price.
  2. Develop a database room that is used to store the user data which has already been added by the user in the cart and the user can also remove the previously added item in the cart.
  3. Develop a good UI design that is user friendly to the user.
  4. Develop a good UI that is supported for all android devices.
